# Bikeshare Data Analysis

This project is part of the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree at Udacity. It involves analyzing bikeshare data from three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze bikeshare data to gain insights into the usage patterns and trends in different cities. The project includes the following tasks:
- Loading and filtering the data based on user input.
- Calculating and displaying various statistics, such as popular travel times, popular stations, and trip durations.
- Providing an interactive user experience by allowing users to choose the city and time period they want to analyze.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required software and libraries installed.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `bikeshare.py` file using the command `python bikeshare.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program and analyze the bikeshare data.

## Data Files

The bikeshare data files for each city are not included in this repository due to their large size. However, you can download the data files from the following sources:
